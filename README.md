Live project here: https://react-custom-pagination-expressjs.netlify.app/

Tools used: 
1. HTML, CSS, BootStrap, ReactJs for the design
2. Node and Express for the Backend
3. REST API for fetching data from the server

About the Project:
1. The users data gets populated to the table from the API on the express server
2. The users can select the number of data to view per page, the options are 5/10/20 users per page
3. The pagination component lets the user navigate to one page at a time with a single < or > button or directly go to the first or last page, after clicking the << or >> button.
4. The data comes according to the server logic as the server only sends the amount of users needed according to the page limit
